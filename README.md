# chat_app

This repository contains a Flutter project that implements a Chat GPT clone using an API. It allows users to have interactive conversations with an AI-powered chatbot.<br/>

## Features
Chat interface: Users can interact with the chatbot through a user-friendly interface. <br/>
AI-powered responses: The chatbot uses the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model to generate intelligent and context-aware responses. <br/>
Real-time communication: The app communicates with a backend API to send user input and receive chatbot responses in real-time. <br/>
History log: The app maintains a history log of the conversation, displaying both user messages and chatbot responses. <br/>


## Usage
Open the app on your device or emulator. <br/>
Enter your message in the text input field and press Enter or the send button.<br/>
The chatbot will generate a response based on your input, and it will appear in the chat interface.<br/>
Continue the conversation by sending more messages, and the chatbot will provide appropriate responses.<br/>

## API Configuration
To use this app, you need to configure the backend API. Follow these steps:<br/>

Create an account and obtain an API key from an AI language model provider (e.g., OpenAI).<br/>
Open the project in your preferred code editor.<br/>
Locate the API configuration file (e.g., api_config.dart) in the project's source code.<br/>
Replace the placeholder API key with your actual API key.<br/>
Save the changes.<br/>
